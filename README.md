Pallet Colour Generator

This App running with Flask allows the user to upload an image and then the user will see the most common colors that it has

The calculations were made with NumPy pixel by pixel and showning the first 50 (and most frequent colors)

Some room for improvement of course but as a first version, it`s good enough for me.

Enjoy !!!!
